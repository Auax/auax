# About me
Hi! I'm Ibai, a programmer from Spain. I learned Python in a course at the age of 13. I use Python but I want to learn other languages such as C++ to make videogames in UE4 and more JS.

If you want to contact me or ask me any questions, you can send me a DM through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/349495905151483915) (zellius#1000). I most likely won't accept any friend request so just join some server I'm in (for example [TPH](https://discord.gg/programming)).

## My hobbies and school
I enjoy programming, making video games, and 3D. I go to high school and want to study Computer Engineering.

## My projects
My actual projects are [`Python trojan`](https://github.com/auax/trojan) - a simple EDUCATIONAL ONLY trojan for Windows, Linux, and macOS (still in development) and more interesting projects related to ML and DEEP LEARNING.
